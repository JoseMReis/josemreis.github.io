Very preliminary work which may or may not end up as an article later on, and so all feedback is very much welcome!\n“Sykes-Picot”, Trotsky, and the Prohibition Against Secret International Agreements Following its 100th birthday, the Sykes-Picot Agreement1, officially known as the Asia Minor Agreement, re-entered the public sphere mostly due to its legacy2.\n Colonel Sir Mark Sykes   In this agreement, which received its name from being negotiated by the British diplomat Mark Sykes and its french counter-part Francois Georges-Picot, the British and French powers (later assented by the Russian Empire) covertly agreed on how the falling Ottoman Empire should be carved out. The lines drawn still shape parts of modern middle east.\n the 1916 Map (source: BBC, 2016)   There is, however, a aspect of this international agreement that is less discussed: the secrecy of its making. This aspect was as relevant then as it is now.\n“Trotsky-leaks” and its impact on public opinion Contrary to popular expectations, the registration (and even ratification) of international agreements was a mid- to late-20th century novelty3. Before, secret international agreements were a very common tool of international relations. Secret diplomacy was, well, diplomacy. And, as such, the status-quo. This would soon change.\nIt’s 1917. Enter Leon Trotsky, Foreign Affairs Commissar to the novel Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Upon getting access to the Tsarist foreign relations files, the new incumbent finds a memorandum containing the text of the Sykes-Picot Agreement, by then assented by the previous Russian Empire. And with it, evidence of secret diplomacy with large implications as well as of possible double-dealing by the imperial powers - “[evidence of]…France and Britain as duplicitous in relation to the Arabs”4\n Leon Trotsky   Possibly due to the embarrassment it could cause to the imperial powers, or due to the Russian claims to the former Ottoman empire being denied in the aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution. The Commissariat disclosed the complete agreement in Russian newspapers, the Izvestia and Pravda, on 23 November 1917; subsequently, the Manchester Guardian printed the texts on November 26, 1917.\n Manchester Guardian, November 26, 1917   Not too dissimilar from the leaked diplomatic-cables following Wikileaks, the leaked secret treaties caused great agitation after being re-published in most major newspapers: “Public opinion in Europe and beyond was \u0026quot;deeply shocked\u0026quot; by the knowledge that the major powers had promised one thing in public while they agreed to something else in private.”5\n The prohibition against secret International Agreements  Woodrow Wilson (source: Politico, 2015)   Some historians have argued that the public reaction to the disclosures impacted the North-American President Woodrow Wilson6 and were reflected on his famous Fourteen Points Speech7, his “programme of the world’s peace”, on its first point calling for open covenants, openly arrived at and for no private international understandings of any kind.\n Excerpt of the original speech   Amidst this climate of contestation, many called for more transparency in international lawmaking, with positions ranging from open-door negotiations to more minimalist rules such as the mandatory publication of international agreements8. Positions clustering around the latter were crystallized in two rules:\n Article 18, Covenant of the League of Nations, which read: “Every treaty or international engagement entered into hereafter by any Member of the League shall be forthwith registered with the Secretariat and shall as soon as possible be published by it. No such treaty or international engagement shall be binding until so registered.”  And, later-on, at the United Nations…\n Article 102, paragraph 1, of the Charter of the United Nations stating that: “Every treaty and every international agreement entered into by any Member of the United Nations after the present Charter comes into force shall as soon as possible be registered with the Secretariat and published by it.”; and in its paragraph 2: “No party to any such treaty or international agreement which has not been registered in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article may invoke that treaty or agreement before any organ of the United Nations.”.    Some theory: why write it down? or why secret treaties are quite puzzling Starting point: a (very) brief intro to compliance theory For rationalist accounts of international cooperation, secret international agreements ought to be quite puzzling.\nAccording to these models, the credibility and enforceability of an agreement seem to rely, in one way or another, on a certain degree of information being made available to various key actors.\nIn particular, from this viewpoint, there seems to be four main rationales for stable international cooperation in the absence of a central enforcer:\nThe agreement is self-enforcing (e.g. pure coordination game - i.e. no party has an incentive to defect, think of standardization agreements…);\n States fear suffering reputational costs which may endanger future cooperation (e.g. Brewster 2009; Guzman 2008);\n Reciprocity and fear of retaliatory action (Axelrod 2006) (think of trade agreements..);\n Or through domestic (or international) enforcement and domestic audience costs, namely through the judiciary branch (Powell and Staton 2009), international adjudicating bodies, or political pressure and mobilization by domestic constituencies, such as voters, lobbies, or NGOs(Dai 2005; Simmons 2009).\n   The puzzle: most mechanisms of compliance are not applicable to secret treaties, so why bother? However, most of these mechanisms are extremely feeble in the realm of secret international agreements (SIAs):\n The reputational mechanism will become weaker since defections are now private information hidden from domestic and external audiences. Being so, third-States will not be able to update their beliefs about the type of the defector which will then decrease the expected reputational costs of a defection.\n The scope for retaliation and for tit-for-tat is also narrower in SIAs. Retaliatory action outside of the scope of the agreement, e.g. sanctions or a sudden aversion to cooperation with the defector in other issue-areas, may increase the risk of detection of the SIA by domestic and external audiences, as they are highly visible and need parliamentary approval at times (e.g. sanctions).\n Similarly, it is hard to see how one would enforce these agreements through domestic or international adjudicating bodies9;\n or how a defecting state may be deterred by the expected domestic audience costs of breaking a promise that is not known by those very same audiences and constituencies.\n  And so, here’s our conundrum:\nwhy would states engage in the costs of formalizing secret promises into international agreements if no benefits may be obtained therefrom in terms of credibility or enforceability? \n Why not resort to, as Machiavelli advises10, “verbal agreements” instead?11\n    Empirical analysis of UK’s unpublished International Agreements Preparing the data The dataset contains \\(13,576\\) international agreements, as well as their relevant metadata, concluded by the United Kingdom. It includes bi- and multi-lateral instruments of various forms - ranging from exchange of letters and MoUs to conventions.\nThe oldest international agreement in our dataset is the Treaty of Defensive Alliance between Great Britain and Portugal, and it was signed on May 16th, 1703; whereas the most recent, Bilateral Agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States of America on Prudential Measures regarding Insurance and Reinsurance , was signed on December the 18th, 2018.\nThe data was exported from FCO’s treaty database using the following query.\nWe start by loading our dataset, removing documents which are not international agreements, and cleaning up the variable names.\n### load tidyverse require(tidyverse) ### plot characteristics require(hrbrthemes) ### plot charachteristics theme_set(theme_ipsum_rc(axis_title_size = 10, axis_title_face = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;, caption_face = \u0026quot;italic\u0026quot;, plot_title_size = \u0026quot;14\u0026quot;, caption_size = 10, axis_text_size = 12, strip_text_size = 10)) ### options options(extrafont::loadfonts()) ### Load the data sia_uk \u0026lt;- read.csv(file = \u0026quot;data/AggregateMetadata.csv\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% as_tibble() %\u0026gt;% filter(str_detect(Title, regex(\u0026quot;treat(y|ies)\\\\s+series\u0026quot;, ignore_case = TRUE)) == FALSE) %\u0026gt;% # not treaties, remove.. set_names(names(.) %\u0026gt;% str_to_lower() %\u0026gt;% str_replace_all(\u0026quot;\\\\.\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;_\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% select(document_id, title, country , treaty_type, date_of_signature, adopted_date, def_eif_date, terminated_date, place_of_signature, publication_records, subject) We end up with this dataset.\nglimpse(sia_uk) ## Observations: 13,576 ## Variables: 11 ## $ document_id \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 62932, 72663, 62206, 75243, 74893, 58257, 75… ## $ title \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026quot;Treaty Between Her Majesty The Queen Of Eng… ## $ country \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026quot;JOHANNA ; UNITED KINGDOM \u0026quot;, \u0026quot;FRANCE ; SWITZ… ## $ treaty_type \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; BI , MULTI , BI , BI , BI , BI , BI , BI , B… ## $ date_of_signature \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; 08/11/1844 , 25/05/1946 , 31/10/2007 , 06/02… ## $ adopted_date \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , … ## $ def_eif_date \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; 08/11/1844 , , 01/01/2009 , , 01/06/1995 , ,… ## $ terminated_date \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; , , , , , , , 30/06/1955 , , , , , , , , , ,… ## $ place_of_signature \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; Montsamolo , Washington , London , London , … ## $ publication_records \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026quot;British State Papers (BSP) 32/1236/0: 0;Tre… ## $ subject \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026quot;SLAVERY \u0026quot;, \u0026quot;PROPERTY \u0026quot;, \u0026quot;TAXATION \u0026quot;, \u0026quot;RED C… Data wrangling We finish up by cleaning up the data. First, we clean up some string variables and turn all dates into date format using the lubridate package. Next, we keep only treaties which were concluded by the united kingdom, and not by, say, a colony for simplicity sake. Finally, we remove the united kingdom from the country variable since that is not informative.\nrequire(lubridate) sia_uk \u0026lt;- sia_uk %\u0026gt;% ## keep only treaties concluded by the UK (not, say, a colony) filter(str_detect(country, regex(\u0026quot;\\\\;\\\\s{1,}united\\\\s+kingdom\u0026quot;, ignore_case = TRUE))) %\u0026gt;% mutate_if(is.character, str_trim) %\u0026gt;% mutate(date_of_signature = lubridate::dmy(date_of_signature), adopted_date = dmy(adopted_date), def_eif_date = dmy(def_eif_date), terminated_date = lubridate::dmy(terminated_date), country = str_to_lower(country), country= str_remove(country, \u0026quot;\\\\;\\\\s{1,}united\\\\s+kingdom\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% str_replace_all(., \u0026quot;(?\u0026lt;=[a-z]|;)\\\\s{2,}|\\\\s{2,}(?=[a-z]|;)\u0026quot;, \u0026quot; \u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% str_trim()) Next, we tidy up the data. In a tidy dataset (i) each variable must have its own column; (ii) each observation must have its own row; (iii) each value must have its own cell.\n The logic of tidy data (Hadley Wickham \u0026amp; Garrett Grolemund)   This is not the case in this dataset. Observations, namely the state-parties to the agreements, are clustered in one cell. And so, we will have to split up the country variable and then add the remaining rows.\nBelow you will find a, admittedly, hacky way of going around this problem. We split the country vector using a regular expression for \u0026quot; ; \u0026quot; and add the document id, replicated by the number of appearances of the split-pattern \u0026quot; ; \u0026quot;, and use the id to left_join() the remaining dataset.\nParty-level data increases the number of observations to \\(111,772\\).\ntidy_sia \u0026lt;- tibble(unlist(str_split(sia_uk$country, \u0026quot;\\\\s+;\\\\s+\u0026quot;))) %\u0026gt;% set_names(\u0026quot;counter_party\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% mutate(document_id = rep(sia_uk$document_id, sapply(str_split(sia_uk$country, \u0026quot;\\\\s+;\\\\s+\u0026quot;), length))) %\u0026gt;% left_join(., sia_uk) nrow(tidy_sia) ## [1] 111772 Finally, we standardize the country names using the, surprisingly useful for public international lawyers, countrycode::countrycode() function. Because running this function on \\(100,000+\\) observations would take a lot of time, I will run it only on a new data frame with the unique counter party names, standardize them,left_join() it into the main dataset, and assign it to a new object.\nrequire(countrycode) tidy_sia2 \u0026lt;- tidy_sia %\u0026gt;% distinct(counter_party, .keep_all = TRUE) %\u0026gt;% mutate(stand_country = countrycode(counter_party, \u0026#39;country.name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;country.name.en\u0026#39;, origin_regex = TRUE)) %\u0026gt;% mutate(stand_country = replace(stand_country, which(counter_party == \u0026quot;virgin islands\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;British Virgin Islands\u0026quot;), stand_country = replace(stand_country, which(str_detect(counter_party, \u0026quot;european\u0026quot;)), \u0026quot;EC/EU\u0026quot;), stand_country = replace(stand_country, which(str_detect(counter_party, \u0026quot;french\u0026quot;)), \u0026quot;France\u0026quot;), stand_country = replace(stand_country, which(str_detect(counter_party, \u0026quot;portuguese\u0026quot;)), \u0026quot;Portugal\u0026quot;), stand_country = replace(stand_country, which(str_detect(counter_party, \u0026quot;dutch\u0026quot;)), \u0026quot;Netherlands\u0026quot;), stand_country = replace(stand_country, which(str_detect(counter_party, \u0026quot;spanish\u0026quot;)), \u0026quot;Spain\u0026quot;), stand_country = replace(stand_country, which(counter_party == \u0026quot;antilles\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;Antilles\u0026quot;), stand_country = replace(stand_country, which(counter_party == \u0026quot;irish free state\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;Ireland\u0026quot;), stand_country = replace(stand_country, which(counter_party == \u0026quot;tripoli\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;Libya\u0026quot;), stand_country = replace(stand_country, which(counter_party == \u0026quot;tunis\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;Tunisia\u0026quot;), stand_country = replace(stand_country, which(counter_party == \u0026quot;serbia and montenegro\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;Serbia and Montenegro\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% mutate(stand_country = if_else(is.na(stand_country), counter_party, stand_country)) %\u0026gt;% select(counter_party, stand_country) wd \u0026lt;- left_join(tidy_sia, tidy_sia2) %\u0026gt;% mutate(stand_country = if_else(is.na(stand_country), counter_party, stand_country))   Exploratory data analysis 1: UK treaty practice Let’s explore the dataset a bit.\nA first question to ask is who are UKs most frequent cooperative partners? This can be answered by mapping UK’s treaty-making.\nThe first step for building a map of UK’s treaty-making is get each counter-parties central coordinates. Going to use ggplot2’s map_data the coordinates data.\ngeo_data \u0026lt;- map_data(\u0026quot;world\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% as_tibble() %\u0026gt;% select(stand_country = region, long, lat, group) %\u0026gt;% mutate(stand_country = countrycode(stand_country, \u0026quot;country.name\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;country.name.en\u0026quot;, origin_regex = TRUE))  To map the frequency of treaty-making with the UK we first have to generate a world map using the entire geo_data dataset - this can be achieved through a geom_polygon(). To capture the distribution of the relevant count variable, I will colour each country depending on the number of IAs they concluded with the UK (lighter colours meaning less, and darker more).\n### number of treaties per party party_stats \u0026lt;- wd %\u0026gt;% group_by(stand_country) %\u0026gt;% summarise(n = n()) %\u0026gt;% ungroup() ## add the stats to the map data and plot a map with the IA counts left_join(geo_data, party_stats) %\u0026gt;% arrange(n) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x=long, y = lat, group = group, fill = n)) + geom_polygon() + scale_fill_distiller(name=\u0026quot;number of IAs\\nconcluded with the UK\u0026quot;, trans = \u0026quot;reverse\u0026quot;,breaks = seq(0, max(party_stats$n), by = 300)) + theme_minimal() + theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(), axis.text.x=element_blank(), axis.ticks.x=element_blank(), axis.title.y=element_blank(), axis.text.y=element_blank(), axis.ticks.y=element_blank())  We can see from the map that the top-5 repeat players are European. A distant outlier, it’s France, with \\(2898\\) IAs followed by the Netherlands (\\(2045\\)), Belgium (\\(1961\\)), Italy (\\(1936\\)), and Germany (\\(1923\\)).\nTo get a broader picture of the cooperation patterns we can also plot a wordcloud using the wordcloud::wordcloud() function.\nrequire(RColorBrewer) pal \u0026lt;- brewer.pal(6, \u0026quot;Blues\u0026quot;) ## remove the two lightest tones of the palette (white, basically...) pal \u0026lt;- pal[-(1:2)] set.seed(1234) # for reproducibility ## plot the word cloud party_stats %\u0026gt;% distinct(stand_country, .keep_all = TRUE) %\u0026gt;% with(wordcloud::wordcloud(stand_country, n, random.order = FALSE, colors = pal)) We can repeat the process below to get the gist of the frequency of international agreements by subject, as defined by the FCO. What we find is not surprising, since subject-areas such as taxation, aviation, debt, and investment protection were, and some still are, overwhelmingly bilateral.\nrequire(RColorBrewer) pal \u0026lt;- brewer.pal(6, \u0026quot;Blues\u0026quot;) ## remove the two lightest tones of the palette (white, basically...) pal \u0026lt;- pal[-(1:2)] ### number of treaties per party subj_stats \u0026lt;- wd %\u0026gt;% mutate(subject = str_to_title(subject)) %\u0026gt;% distinct(document_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %\u0026gt;% filter(str_detect(subject, \u0026quot;\\\\(\u0026quot;) == FALSE) %\u0026gt;% group_by(subject) %\u0026gt;% summarise(n = n()) %\u0026gt;% ungroup() set.seed(1234) # for reproducibility ## plot the word cloud subj_stats %\u0026gt;% with(wordcloud::wordcloud(subject, n, random.order = FALSE, colors = pal)) What we get is not surprising. The subject-areas with the highest frequency of international agreements are areas which were, and for most, still are, markedly bilateral.\nAlso interesting may be to assess international lawmaking practices across time.

We will have to tidy it up.\n### make the dataset tidy_pub \u0026lt;- tibble(unlist(str_split(sia_uk$publication_records, \u0026quot;(\\\\s+)?;(\\\\s+)?\u0026quot;))) %\u0026gt;% set_names(\u0026quot;publication_record_raw\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% mutate(document_id = rep(sia_uk$document_id, sapply(str_split(sia_uk$publication_records, \u0026quot;(\\\\s+)?;(\\\\s+)?\u0026quot;), length))) %\u0026gt;% left_join(., sia_uk) %\u0026gt;% mutate(publication_record = map_chr(publication_record_raw, function(word) { output \u0026lt;- str_split(word, \u0026quot;\\\\s+\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% unlist() %\u0026gt;% `[`(1:4) %\u0026gt;% subset(!is.na(.)) %\u0026gt;% paste(collapse = \u0026quot; \u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% str_extract(.,regex(\u0026quot;[\\\\w\\\\s]+\u0026quot;, ignore_case = TRUE)) %\u0026gt;% str_remove(., regex(\u0026quot;[0-9]+|(V|v)(o|0)l(\\\\.|ume|UME)?|(no|No|NO)(?!t)|^[A-Z]{1,2}(?=\\\\s{1,4})|(?\u0026lt;=\\\\s{1,4})[A-Z]{1,2}$\u0026quot;, ignore_case = TRUE)) %\u0026gt;% str_trim() return(output)}), publication_record = replace(publication_record, which(str_detect(publication_records, regex(\u0026quot;UN\\\\s+reg|League\\\\s+of\\\\s+Nati|united\\\\s+nations\u0026quot;, ignore_case = TRUE))), \u0026quot;LoN/UN Registration\u0026quot;), publication_record = replace(publication_record, which(str_detect(publication_records, regex(\u0026quot;other.*(?!published)\u0026quot;, ignore_case = TRUE))), \u0026quot;Other\u0026quot;), publication_record = replace(publication_record, which(str_detect(publication_records, regex(\u0026quot;no.*publi\u0026quot;, ignore_case = TRUE))), \u0026quot;Not Published\u0026quot;), publication_record = replace(publication_record, which(str_detect(publication_records, regex(\u0026quot;(?\u0026lt;=an|ese|zealand|ish|states|ceylon).*treaty\\\\s+series|country\\\\s+series\u0026quot;, ignore_case = TRUE))), \u0026quot;Other Countries\u0026#39; Treaty Series\u0026quot;), publication_record = replace(publication_record, which(str_detect(publication_records, regex(\u0026quot;European|Official\\\\s+Journal\u0026quot;, ignore_case = TRUE))), \u0026quot;EC/EU Official Journal\u0026quot;), publication_record = replace(publication_record, which(str_detect(publication_records, regex(\u0026quot;command\u0026quot;, ignore_case = TRUE))), \u0026quot;Command Papers\u0026quot;), publication_record = replace(publication_record, which(str_detect(publication_records, regex(\u0026quot;treaty\\\\s+series\\\\s+ts\u0026quot;, ignore_case = TRUE))), \u0026quot;Treaty Series\u0026quot;)) ## load packages we will use require(kableExtra) require(formattable) ## prepare the table with the counts my_table \u0026lt;- tidy_pub %\u0026gt;% group_by(publication_record) %\u0026gt;% summarise(n = n()) %\u0026gt;% ungroup() %\u0026gt;% arrange(desc(n)) %\u0026gt;% filter(!is.na(publication_record) \u0026amp; n \u0026gt; 1) %\u0026gt;% rename(`Publication Record` = \u0026quot;publication_record\u0026quot;) ## make a \u0026quot;formattable\u0026quot; html table formattable(my_table, list( `Publication Record` = formatter(\u0026quot;span\u0026quot;, style = x ~ ifelse(x == \u0026quot;Not Published\u0026quot;, style(color = \u0026quot;lightseagreen\u0026quot;, font.weight = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;), NA)), n = color_bar(\u0026quot;lightseagreen\u0026quot;)) )   Publication Record  n      LoN/UN Registration   11690    Other Countries’ Treaty Series   7375    Treaty Series   2084    PRO   2041    Command Papers   1028    Not Published   879    British State Papers   642    EC/EU Official Journal   602    Miscellaneous Series   477    Other   233    Treaties Laid before Parliament  157    Hertslet   132    FCO   60    House of Commons Papers   27    Handbook of Commercial Treaties  16    Aitchison   15    Statutory Instruments   12    Handbook of Commercial Treates   5    Eire Treaty Series   4     Above, we see where each of our international agreements were published according to FCO’s database.\nMost of them were registered by the League of Nations or the UN treaty registry. Domestically, we find many different sources but most were at least published at the Treaty Series, PRO Records, and at the Command Papers (government publications).\nMore relevantly, \\(879\\) international agreements were marked as Not Published by the FCO. Below I will explore the characteristics of these agreements.\nLooking into lateralism, there seem to be two theoretical reasons to expect the majority of unpublished international agreements to be bilateral rather than multilateral.\nFirst, multilateralism in the absence of strict reciprocity, Olsonean “privileged groups”, or an Hegemon, may enhance enforcement problems since, the ratio of individual benefts obtained from enforcing the agreement is expected to decrease as the number of parties increases and this may induce the free-ridding of enforcement efforts. Thus, parties are expected to resort to more “compliance-robust” forms of cooperation and public agreements, for the reasons explained above, all things equal, should be more cooperation inducive than hidden ones.\nSecondly, because the probability of a “hidden” agreement being accidentally, or purposefully, disclosed should be higher as the number of parties increases.\nTo a certain extent, our data seems to provide some suggestive support to this.\ntidy_pub %\u0026gt;% mutate(treaty_type = str_to_lower(treaty_type)) %\u0026gt;% distinct(document_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %\u0026gt;% group_by(document_id) %\u0026gt;% mutate(not_published = ifelse(any(publication_record == \u0026quot;Not Published\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;not published\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;published\u0026quot;), not_published = replace(not_published, which(is.na(not_published)), \u0026quot;unknown\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% ungroup() %\u0026gt;% group_by(not_published, treaty_type) %\u0026gt;% mutate(n = n()) %\u0026gt;% ungroup() %\u0026gt;% filter(not_published != \u0026quot;unknown\u0026quot; \u0026amp; nchar(treaty_type) \u0026gt; 1) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(not_published, fill = factor(not_published))) + geom_bar() + scale_y_continuous(breaks= seq(0, 6500, 500)) + facet_wrap(~treaty_type) + labs(x = \u0026quot;published?\u0026quot;) + guides(fill=FALSE, colour = FALSE)  Looking into the issue-area of the unpublished international agreements, we find both expectable as well as surprising findings.\ntidy_pub %\u0026gt;% group_by(document_id) %\u0026gt;% mutate(not_published = ifelse(any(publication_record == \u0026quot;Not Published\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;not published\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;published\u0026quot;), not_published = replace(not_published, which(is.na(not_published)), \u0026quot;unknown\u0026quot;), subject = str_to_lower(subject)) %\u0026gt;% ungroup() %\u0026gt;% group_by(subject, not_published) %\u0026gt;% summarise(n = n()) %\u0026gt;% ungroup() %\u0026gt;% filter(not_published == \u0026quot;not published\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% arrange(desc(n)) %\u0026gt;% top_n(40) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(reorder(factor(subject), +n), n)) + geom_bar(stat = \u0026quot;identity\u0026quot;) + coord_flip() + labs(x = \u0026quot;subject\u0026quot;) Trade, loans and credits, defence, and financial compensation matters appearing as the four most frequent issues of unpublished international agreements is reasonable given the frequent strict-reciprocity between cooperative parties in these matters (think trade and defence), which should facilitate de enforceability and credibility of the promisses. Similarly, another possible explanations stems from these areas being prone to politically sensitive promisses.\nIn the beggining of this post we talked about of how there seems to have been a norm- and legal-change regarding covert international agreements. This raises several questions, the main being: did the prohibitions against secret international agreements actually work?\nBefore going further, I want to point out that this analysis is purely exploratory. The world is complex and full of co-variation, and plotting time-trends without controling for any of this complexity doesn’t provide us with enough information. Still, it’s something interesting to explore.\nWe start by plotting the number of international agreement by whether they were published, not published, or publication status unknown across the entire time-period covered by our data. The red dotted-line marks the birth of the League of Nations, and of Art. 18 of its Covenant; and the black dotted-line marks the birth of the United Nations along with Art. 102 of its Charter.\nWhile we are unable to get any information on the impact of the norm change at this scale, there are a couple of interesting things happening here. In the case of the UK, one observes that until late-19th century and the beggining of the 20th there seems to have been a general practice of publicizing its international agreements. As one reaches the years leading to WW1, we observe a relatively steep increase in the proportion of unpublished international agreements. This is in line with the inter-war realpolitik which marked the period.\ntidy_pub %\u0026gt;% group_by(document_id) %\u0026gt;% mutate(not_published = ifelse(any(publication_record == \u0026quot;Not Published\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;not published\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;published\u0026quot;), not_published = replace(not_published, which(is.na(not_published)), \u0026quot;unknown\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% ungroup() %\u0026gt;% mutate(year = year(date_of_signature)) %\u0026gt;% group_by(year, not_published) %\u0026gt;% mutate(n = n()) %\u0026gt;% ungroup() %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(year, n, colour = factor(not_published))) + geom_line(size = 1) + geom_smooth(aes(fill = factor(not_published))) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1700, 2018, 25)) + geom_vline(xintercept = 1920, linetype = \u0026quot;dashed\u0026quot;, color= \u0026quot;darkred\u0026quot;, size = .8) + geom_vline(xintercept = 1945, linetype = \u0026quot;dashed\u0026quot;, labels=\u0026quot;UN Charter\u0026quot;, show.legend = TRUE, colour = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, size = .8)+ scale_fill_brewer() + facet_wrap(~not_published, ncol = 1, scales = \u0026quot;free_y\u0026quot;) + guides(fill=FALSE, colour = FALSE) To get a better picture of the relationship between Art. 18 and Art. 102 with UK’s publicity practices, we zoom-in.\ntidy_pub %\u0026gt;% filter(date_of_signature \u0026gt; dmy(\u0026quot;01-01-1900\u0026quot;) \u0026amp; date_of_signature \u0026lt; dmy(\u0026quot;01-01-1960\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% group_by(document_id) %\u0026gt;% mutate(not_published = ifelse(any(publication_record == \u0026quot;Not Published\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;not published\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;published\u0026quot;), not_published = replace(not_published, which(is.na(not_published)), \u0026quot;unknown\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% ungroup() %\u0026gt;% mutate(year = year(date_of_signature)) %\u0026gt;% group_by(year, not_published) %\u0026gt;% mutate(n = n()) %\u0026gt;% ungroup() %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(year, n, colour = factor(not_published))) + geom_line(size = .8) + geom_smooth(aes(fill = factor(not_published))) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1900, 1960, 4)) + geom_vline(xintercept = 1920, linetype = \u0026quot;dashed\u0026quot;, color= \u0026quot;darkred\u0026quot;, size = .8) + geom_vline(xintercept = 1945, linetype = \u0026quot;dashed\u0026quot;, labels=\u0026quot;UN Charter\u0026quot;, show.legend = TRUE, colour = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, size = .8)+ scale_fill_brewer() + facet_wrap(~not_published, ncol = 1, scales = \u0026quot;free_y\u0026quot;) + guides(fill=FALSE, colour = FALSE) The plot seems to be in line with current research. In a fantastic and highly detailed historical analysis, Megan Donaldson looked into the survival of the secreat treaty following birth of the League of Nations and United Nations. According to her archival research the expected norm-change towards “open covenants, openly arrived at” was never fully realized: Even if democracies make relatively few secret treaties, the overall workings of treaty-making offer a contrast with the hopes of 191912\nWe do not observe any relevant change in the amount of unpublished agreements being concluded following the birth of the league of nations. Furthermore, as we approach its collapse and the years leading to the second world war, we see a spike in covert treaty-making. This trend decreases slightly following the approval of Art. 102 of the Charter but just to increase again, reaching the maxima of the curve in the two years following it. After 1948 we observe a gradual decline of unpublished international agreements and an increase in the number of published international agreements. Still, the secret treaty survives.\nYet, empirically disantangling the effect of the emergence of the prohibition against secret international agreements requires a more thorough and not purely descriptive analysis.
